# Command Injection

Command injection is a security flaw where an attacker exploits an application by using unsanitized user input to execute unauthorized commands on the operating system. These commands execute with the same privileges as the application, potentially compromising the host server.

Simply put, command injection allows attackers to run arbitrary operating system commands on the server where the application is running.

This vulnerability can occur for several reasons:

1. Improper validation of user input
2. Insufficient protection against command injection attacks
3. Poorly written code that enables command execution on the server

## Types of Command Injection

1. **In-band command Injection**- An attacker can execute command in the Host operating system via the application and receive the response of the command in the application.
2. **Blind command Injection** - where attacker can execute command on the Host operation system via vulnerable application and did not get the output of the command in the HTTP response.  

## Impact of command Injection

### 1. Unauthorized Access to the application and Host operation system

- **confidentiality**- command injection can be used to see sensitive data of the application
- **Integrity** - command injection can be used to alter the content of the application
- **availability** - command injection can be used to delete the content of the application.

### 2. Remote code Execution on the operating system




## How to Exploit the Command Injection

Testing can be done from two perspectives: white box and black box. In white box testing, we have access to the program code to understand and find bypass techniques. In black box testing, we work without access to the source code and must test all possible vulnerabilities.

Steps for testing both black box and white box approaches:

- Map the applicationâ€”visit every entry point where users can input data. During this process, use Burp to capture all requests for later analysis.
- Identify input fields vulnerable to injection by testing shell command operators like '&', '&&', '|', '||', and '$()'.
