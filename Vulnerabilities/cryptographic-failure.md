# Cryptographic Failure
In an increasingly digital world, securing data through cryptography is crucial to protecting sensitive information. Before diving into cryptographic techniques, it's important to first understand data encryption—its purpose, how it works, and its role in safeguarding communications? When data is sent from a client to a server, it isn't transmitted as plain text. Instead, the data is encrypted, making it unreadable to humans. Upon receipt, the data is decrypted using a private key or reverse engineering. This process of encrypting and decrypting data is known as cryptography.

Client-server communication is based on specific protocols, with the most common being SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security). These protocols form the foundation of secure client-server communication. Data can be encrypted using various formats or algorithms.


Cryptographic failures occur when an application doesn't follow the proper protocol, uses an outdated version of the protocol, or employs old hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1. Hashing is typically a one-way encryption that cannot be decrypted without the correct key. However, these older hashing techniques are no longer secure.


## For any web application, it's crucial to consider the following questions:

1.	**Is data transmitted in clear text?**
   
2.	**Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used, either by default or in older code?**
	
3.	**Are default cryptographic keys used, or are weak cryptographic keys generated or reused? Is proper key management missing?**
	
4.	**Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA-1 in use, or are non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash functions are needed?**
	
5.	**Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in the absence of a password-based key derivation function?**
   
Additionally, consider whether the application is using up-to-date and secure cryptographic libraries and whether regular security audits are conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Examples: 
**Scenario #1**: An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. However, this data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.

**Scenario #2**: A site doesn't use or enforce TLS for all pages or supports weak encryption. An attacker monitors network traffic (e.g., at an insecure wireless network), downgrades connections from HTTPS to HTTP, intercepts requests, and steals the user's session cookie.

**Scenario #3**: The password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated hashes

## Here are a few real-world scenarios of cryptographic failures:

1. **Heartbleed Vulnerability**: Discovered in 2014, Heartbleed was a severe vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allowed attackers to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL, potentially exposing sensitive data such as private keys, usernames, and passwords.

2. **Dual EC DRBG Backdoor**: In 2007, it was revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) had introduced a backdoor in the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator (Dual EC DRBG). This backdoor allowed the NSA to potentially decrypt data that was supposed to be secure.

3. **WhatsApp Encryption Implementation**: In 2016, a flaw was discovered in WhatsApp's encryption implementation. The issue was related to the way WhatsApp handled encryption keys, which could potentially allow attackers to intercept and decrypt messages.


## To mitigate cryptographic failures:
•	**Use strong algorithms**: Choose strong, well-vetted algorithms that resist known attacks. Avoid weak or deprecated algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and DES. Instead, use the latest encryption standards like AES, RSA, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

•	**Manage keys properly**: Use secure key generation with robust random number generators (CSPRNGs).

•	**Implement securely**: Use well-established, peer-reviewed cryptographic libraries. 

•	**Use secure protocols**: Use secure protocols like TLS with forward secrecy (FS) ciphers. 

•	**Conduct regular audits**: Perform regular security audits to keep track of data location, ownership, and security measures. 

•	**Use HTTPS**: Use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

•	**Use strong software**: Use high-level security software that covers malware and viruses. 

•	**Use identity theft and credit monitoring services**: Use these services to be less vulnerable to data breaches. 

•	**Classify and protect data**: Classify and protect data according to security necessities. 

•	**Enable Mask Value in Logs**: Enable masking for policy elements like parameters, headers, and cookies.

•	**Do not use legacy protocols such as FTP and SMTP for transporting sensitive data.**



## Summary
Cryptographic failure is a significant security flaw that can have serious repercussions for a business or company. When data is transmitted over the internet, malicious attackers can intercept and steal it. To prevent this, various encryption protocols and cryptographic algorithms are used to secure the data. However, if a proper cryptographic algorithm or strong protocol is not implemented, or if legacy protocols are used to encrypt sensitive information like passwords or credit card details, it can lead to cryptographic vulnerabilities. 

To avoid such scenarios, it is crucial to implement robust cryptographic algorithms and strong protocols instead of relying on outdated and weak legacy protocols. Additionally, regular updates and security audits should be conducted to ensure the continued effectiveness of these measures. In conclusion, businesses and organizations must prioritize cryptographic security, continually updating protocols and performing regular audits to protect sensitive data from evolving threats.
